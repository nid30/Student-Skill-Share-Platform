# Student Skill-Share & Mentorship Platform 🤝

A web-based platform designed to connect junior and senior students at PESU for mentorship and skill-sharing. This project aims to foster a collaborative and supportive environment within the university, allowing students to easily find and connect with peers for academic and technical guidance.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **User Profiles:** Students can create detailed profiles listing their major, year, courses taken, and skills they possess or wish to learn.
-   **Advanced Mentor Search:** A powerful search engine to find mentors based on criteria like skills, department, or academic year.
-   **Request & Scheduling System:** Mentees can send mentorship requests to seniors. Once accepted, they can schedule sessions through the platform.
-   **Automated Notifications:** Utilizes database triggers to send automated email or in-app notifications for session requests, acceptances, and cancellations.
-   **Feedback and Rating:** A two-way feedback system where both mentors and mentees can rate and review each other after a session. A mentor's average rating is automatically updated.
-   **Analytics Dashboard:** Features leaderboards for top-rated mentors and a personal dashboard for users to view their mentorship history.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Backend:** Python (likely using a framework like Flask or Django)
-   **Database:** SQL
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
